This COVID-19 impact analysis project utilizes Dash and Plotly to visualize pandemic data. It includes key metrics like total cases, active cases, recoveries, and deaths displayed as cards. The dashboard also features interactive elements such as dropdowns for selecting different data views, including hospitalizations, recoveries, and deaths. Visualizations include bar charts showing state-wise data and line charts displaying commodity trends (e.g., masks, sanitizers, oxygen). A pie chart dynamically presents data based on selected zones. This project provides an intuitive interface for exploring and understanding COVID-19 data trends.
